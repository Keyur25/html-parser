# HTML Parser

## About

This is a program that verifies if a file, which contains HTML, has valid HTML tags and that they are nested properly. My application only takes into consideration a certain subset of HTML tags which include: <html>, </html>, <head>, </head>, <body>, </body>, <title>, </title>, <h1>, </h1>, <h2>, </h2>, <h3>, </h3>, <p>, </p>, <ul>, </ul>, <li>, </li>, <a>, </a>, <div>, </div>, <br>, <hr>. If the file contains invalig HTML then my program will display an error message else it will dispaly 'VALID HTML'.

I coded this in Haskell.
