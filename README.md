# HTML Parser

## About

This is a program that verifies if a file, which contains HTML, has valid HTML tags and that they are nested properly. My application only takes into consideration a certain subset of HTML tags which include: html, head, body, title, h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li, a, div, br, hr. If the file contains invalid HTML then my program will display an error message else it will dispaly 'VALID HTML'.

I coded this in Haskell.
